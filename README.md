# Nike Store

This project was my first interaction with Tailwind CSS, with the aim of familiarizing myself with the Framework. I used Nike's aesthetics as a reference for this project, trying to adapt an e-commerce in a different way, to explore the possibilities of the Framework.
I know I still have a lot of room for improvement but I believe this was a good start.
