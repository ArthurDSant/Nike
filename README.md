This project was my first interaction with Tailwind CSS, with the aim of familiarizing myself with the Framework. I used Nike's aesthetics as a reference for this project, trying to adapt an e-commerce in a different way, to explore the possibilities of the Framework.
I know I still have a lot of room for improvement but I believe this was a good start.

## Learnings
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white) Tailwind is a framework that has easy-to-use pre-defined classes, which eliminates the need to write custom CSS code absolutely and gives you the freedom to create reusable styles, making code creation and maintenance simple and effective. I learned the 'Mobile-First' approach that makes it easier to create responsive layouts
. The possibility of customizing the Framework through the 'tailwind.conmfig.js' configuration file is a big difference, allowing precise adjustments when necessary. And the main thing that, in my opinion, makes Tailwind a unique Framework is the efficiency in defining styles, avoiding a huge, confusing and unnecessarily complex CSS file,
making code maintenance and understanding infinitely simpler.

  npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
